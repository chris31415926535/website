I'm a data scientist, researcher, and policy expert who combines data-driven rigour with qualitative insights. My work and research interests include data science in support of the public good, qualitative investigations into consumers' and workers' experiences, and health policy with a focus on digital health and health-system governance.

I have five years' experience in policy and strategy advisory roles with the Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada, and I received my PhD from the University of Toronto in the Philosophy of Modern Physics and an MBA studies from the University of Ottawa. I'm currently doing data science with the [Ottawa Neighbourhood Study](https://www.neighbourhoodstudy.ca), am Principal Investigator on a uOttawa-based qualitative research study on public servants' experiences with meaninglessness at work, and am an independent researcher and data science consultant with my company Belanger Analytics Inc.

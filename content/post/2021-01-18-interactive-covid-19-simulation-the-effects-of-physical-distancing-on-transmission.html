<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This interactive simulation lets you explore how different levels of physical distancing affect the transmission of COVID-19. Each month you choose the percentage of normal interactions people will have, ranging from 100% (business as usual) to 0% (no one interacts with <em>anyone</em>), then press the button to see what happens over the next 30 days. If you like, you can interpret your role as that of a policy-maker in February 2020 who must decide whether (and how much) to “lock down” society.</p>

<h1>The Simulation</h1>

<p>If the simulation isn’t working (which might happen if I hit my Shiiny usage limits), you can <a href="https://github.com/chris31415926535/covid_seir_shiny">grab the code on GitHub here</a> and run it locally to your heart’s content.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-it-work" class="section level1">
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>It’s based on the epidemiological model developed by <span class="citation">Anderson et al. (<a href="#ref-anderson_estimating_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> and presented in <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1.full.pdf">this paper</a>, which is used by the Public Health Agency of Canada in its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/diseases-maladies/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/epidemiological-economic-research-data/update-covid-19-canada-epidemiology-modelling-20210115-en.pdf">official reports</a> <span class="citation">(PHAC <a href="#ref-phac_update_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>, 9)</span>. The authors have created <strong>covidseir</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir">a wonderful R package that you can download and install from GitHub!</a></p>
<p>The model is a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model">the epidemiological SEIR model</a> of how diseases spread. Please see <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1.full.pdf">the paper</a> for details, but at a high level it tracks how people move through six states over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> : Susceptible to the virus;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> : Exposed to the virus;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> : Exposed, pre-symptomatic, and able to infect others;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> : Symptomatic and able to infect others;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> : quarantined; and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> Recovered or deceased.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also six variables for people practicing physical distancing: <span class="math inline">\(S_d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_{1d}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_{2d}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q_d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R_d\)</span>. People are assumed to be immune once they enter state <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>The model describes how these groups change over time with differential equations. I won’t repeat them here (you’re welcome), but I <em>will</em> <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1.full.pdf">link to the paper one more time so you can see them yourselves on pages 6 and 7!</a></p>
<p>In brief, people start out <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>usceptible, then get <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>xposed, then after a while they are both <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>xposed and able to infect others, then they become visibly <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>nfected and symptomatic, then either go straight to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>ecovery, or into <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>uarantine and then into <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>ecovery.</p>
<p>At the same time, people can either start or stop physical distancing when they’re in any of these states; the model assumes that there is some flow back and forth from distancing and not-distancing, but that in general more people start distancing than stop.</p>

<div id="cautionary-notes-about-this-simulation" class="section level1">
<h1>Cautionary notes about this simulation!</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lots of things are missing</strong> from this simulation: loss of life, long-term health effects of COVID-19, social unrest due to lockdowns <em>or</em> due to widespread sickness, the economic effects of lockdowns, the health effects of lockdowns, the <em>distributions</em> of those effects, which <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341245816_The_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_marginalized_populations_in_the_United_States_A_research_agenda">tend to fall on already-disadvantaged communities</a> <span class="citation">(Kantamneni <a href="#ref-kantamneni_impact_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> … it would fascinating to build this into a fuller-fledged simulation, but right now this is just about physical distancing and disease transmission.</li>
<li>Policy changes in physical distancing happen right away: we assume society as a whole turns on a dime, responsive to your whim.</li>
<li>The simulation uses Anderson et al.’s (2020) initial conditions, which represent British Columbia.</li>
<li>The simulation solves the differential equations numerically (using the <strong>deSolve</strong> package) using a resolution of 0.1 days, and then keeps results for whole-numbered time-steps for plotting <span class="citation">(Soetaert et al. <a href="#ref-soetaert_desolve_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>I’m not an epidemiologist</strong> and am not affiliated with Anderson et al. in any way. I just like differential equations.</li>
<li><strong>This is for edutainment purposes only</strong> to learn about how physical distancing can affect COVID-19 prevalence on the population level.
<ul>
<li>It comes with no warranties, guarantees, or manatees!</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>For more robust COVID-19 simulations in R, check out <strong>covidseir</strong></h1>
<p><span class="citation">Anderson (<a href="#ref-anderson_seanandersoncovidseir_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> have made the wonderful <strong>covidseir</strong> package available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir">here</a>. It’s a much more sophisticated implementation that is able to work with real data to make predictions. The only downside is that it’s not on CRAN, which is why I used a different package to solve the ODEs numerically in the Shiny app.</p>

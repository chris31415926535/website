<p>I’m making a quick post now to record some of the pain points I hit trying to get the initial version of this site up and running.</p>
<div id="connecting-rstudio-to-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Connecting RStudio to GitHub</h2>
<p>I’m making a note of this here because I <em>always</em> have trouble getting RStudio to sync with GitHub initially, and then forget what the problem was when it’s time for me to set up a new project. RStudio wouldn’t let me stage most of the blogdown files. So I had to do the following:</p>
<p><code>git add .</code></p>
<p><code>git commit</code></p>
<p><code>git push</code></p>
<p>And don’t be afraid to delete <code>.git/index.lock</code> …</p>

<h2>Connecting GitHub to Netlify</h2>
<p>After following the instructions (here)[<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html</a>] I got this fun error that the internet does not know how to fix:</p>
<p><code>7:25:35 PM: Error: "/opt/build/repo/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/functions/get_address.html:21:1": parse failed: template: partials/functions/get_address.html:21: function "return" not defined</code></p>
<p>The problem is that it wasn’t finding <code>netlify.toml</code>, which the Academic theme puts in a subdirectory where Netlify couldn’t find it. And then once I moved it to the root directory, it contained additional parameters that made Netlify crash in a different way!</p>
<p>The solution was to delete a bunch of problematic stuff from <code>netlify.toml</code> down to this minimum document and put it in the website’s root folder:</p>
<pre><code>[build]
  command = &quot;hugo&quot;
  base    = &quot;&quot;
  publish = &quot;/public&quot;

[build.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = &quot;0.68.3&quot;
  HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = &quot;true&quot;

[context.production.environment]
  HUGO_ENV = &quot;production&quot;


[[headers]]
  for = &quot;*.webmanifest&quot;
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = &quot;application/manifest+json; charset=UTF-8&quot;

[[headers]]
  for = &quot;index.xml&quot;
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = &quot;application/rss+xml&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><em>Then</em> it compiled.</p>

<div id="removing-extraneous-menus" class="section level2">
<h2>Removing extraneous menus</h2>
<p>The list of menus is in this file:</p>
<p><code>config/_default/menus.toml</code></p>
</div>
<div id="also-about-.gitignore.." class="section level2">
<h2>Also, about .gitignore..</h2>

</ul>
<p>If you want git to ignore html files, for example those in the “public” directory, after you update .gitignore you need to do the following to clear git’s cache:</p>
<p><code>git rm -r --cached public/**</code></p>
<p><code>git commit -m "Removed files...."</code></p>
</div>

# About the study

This is a qualitative research study based on interviews with 25 current public servants who self-identified as experiencing meaninglessness at work. We analyzed the nature of the experience, its implications for people, and their responses.

We found that people were harmed by these experiences, making this an issue of ethical importance. We also looked at how meaningless work relates to the notions of [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs), [empty labour](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/empty-labor/958B88831E04F653388CA2127445FEF4), and [functional stupidity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01072.x).

# The abstract from the paper

Research suggests that the experience of meaningless work is prevalent in various occupations,
and that it is destructive for organizations and individuals, making this an issue of major ethical
importance. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study based on interviews with
Canadian public servants who self-identified as experiencing meaninglessness at work. Our main goal is
to better understand participants' responses to the experience of meaningless work and the broader
implications their experiences had on the rest of their lives. We surface and explore the harms inflicted
on participants through their experiences with meaningless work, and suggest that these harms may
have been made worse by structural features of our study's public-sector setting. We contribute to
organization studies literature by showing the intersection of meaningless work with three related
concepts: bullshit jobs, empty labour, and functional stupidity, and argue that our empirical findings
complement and complicate these frameworks by presenting the complex but hidden emotional
experiences that can accompany outwardly observable workplace behaviours.

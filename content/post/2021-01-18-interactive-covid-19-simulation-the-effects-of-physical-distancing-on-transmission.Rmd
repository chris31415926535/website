## Introduction

This interactive simulation lets you explore how different levels of physical distancing affect the transmission of COVID-19. Each month you choose the percentage of normal interactions people will have, ranging from 100% (business as usual) to 0% (no one interacts with *anyone*), then press the button to see what happens over the next 30 days. If you like, you can interpret your role as that of a policy-maker in February 2020 who must decide whether (and how much) to "lock down" society. 

## The Simulation
 
```{r, out.width = "800px", out.height = "600px"}
knitr::include_app(url = "https://chris31415926535.shinyapps.io/covid_seir/")
```

If the simulation isn't working (which might happen if I hit my Shiiny usage limits), you can [grab the code on GitHub here](https://github.com/chris31415926535/covid_seir_shiny) and run it locally to your heart's content.

## Take-Home Messages

I got three big things out of this:

* It's *very easy* for cases to spike out of control if we don't limit our contacts! For context, on January 15, 2021 [British Columbia had 4,604 known active cases](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021HLTH0002-000059)--and in the "business as usual" scenario this model suggests we could see ten or a hundred (!!) times more cases *all at once*.
* Interactions need to come down *a lot* for transmission rates to slow down: on this model, we need to eliminate roughly 40% of contacts to have an effect.
* Consequently, *every interaction matters*! It's not an exaggeration to say that you can save lives by staying home.

## How does it work?

It's based on the epidemiological model developed by @anderson_estimating_2020 and presented in [this paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1.full.pdf), which is used by the Public Health Agency of Canada in its [official reports](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/diseases-maladies/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/epidemiological-economic-research-data/update-covid-19-canada-epidemiology-modelling-20210115-en.pdf) [@phac_update_2021, p. 9]. The authors have created **covidseir**, [a wonderful R package that you can download and install from GitHub!](https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir)

The model is a variant of [the epidemiological SEIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model) of how diseases spread. Please see [the paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1.full.pdf) for details, but at a high level it tracks how people move through six states over time:

* $S$ : Susceptible to the virus;
* $E_1$ : Exposed to the virus;
* $E_2$ : Exposed, pre-symptomatic, and able to infect others;
* $I$ : Symptomatic and able to infect others;
* $Q$ : quarantined; and
* $R$ Recovered or deceased.

There are also six variables for people practicing physical distancing: $S_d$, $E_{1d}$, $E_{2d}$, $I_d$, $Q_d$, and $R_d$. People are assumed to be immune once they enter state $R$.

The model describes how these groups change over time with differential equations. I won't repeat them here (you're welcome), but I *will* [link to the paper one more time so you can see them yourselves on pages 6 and 7!](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1.full.pdf)

In brief, people start out $S$usceptible, then get $E_1$xposed, then after a while they are both $E_2$xposed and able to infect others, then they become visibly $I$nfected and symptomatic, then either go straight to $R$ecovery, or into $Q$uarantine and then into $R$ecovery.

At the same time, people can either start or stop physical distancing when they're in any of these states; the model assumes that there is some flow back and forth from distancing and not-distancing, but that in general more people start distancing than stop.

## Cautionary notes about this simulation!

* **Lots of things are missing** from this simulation: loss of life, long-term health effects of COVID-19, social unrest due to lockdowns *or* due to widespread sickness, the economic effects of lockdowns, the health effects of lockdowns, the *distributions* of those effects, which [tend to fall on already-disadvantaged communities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341245816_The_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_marginalized_populations_in_the_United_States_A_research_agenda) [@kantamneni_impact_2020] ... it would fascinating to build this into a fuller-fledged simulation, but right now this is just about physical distancing and disease transmission.
* Policy changes in physical distancing happen right away: we assume society as a whole turns on a dime, responsive to your whim.
* The simulation uses Anderson et al.'s (2020) initial conditions, which represent British Columbia.
* The simulation solves the differential equations  numerically (using the **deSolve** package) using a resolution of 0.1 days, and then keeps results for whole-numbered time-steps for plotting [@soetaert_desolve_2020].
* **I'm not an epidemiologist** and am not affiliated with Anderson et al. in any way. I just like differential equations.
* **This is for edutainment purposes only** to learn about how physical distancing can affect COVID-19 prevalence on the population level.
  * It comes with no warranties, guarantees, or manatees!

## For more robust COVID-19 simulations in R, check out **covidseir**
  
@anderson_seanandersoncovidseir_2021 have made the wonderful **covidseir** package available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir). It's a much more sophisticated implementation that is able to work with real data to make predictions. The only downside is that it's not on CRAN, which is why I used a different package to solve the ODEs numerically in the Shiny app.

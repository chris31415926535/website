Here's a test post about a hypothetical project I did. I've done some others and I'll put stuff here as soon as I can.

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

tibble(x=rnorm(100),y=runif(100)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("This doesn't mean much!")


```

Ontario Launches New COVID-19 Screening Tool to Help Protect Students and Staff,New Tool Part of the Government’s Plan for the Safe Reopening of Schools,"September 16, 2020",Office of the Premier,"TORONTO — The Ontario government launched a new voluntary interactive screening tool to assist parents, students and staff with the daily assessment of COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors that is required before attending school. The results will let parents, students, and education staff know whether they should attend school each day or guide at-risk individuals to proper resources. This tool is another layer of prevention that the province is using to protect the health and safety of students, staff, and the communities where they live and work.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board.
""We are doing everything we can to keep students and staff safe, and that includes this new screening tool which will help people protect themselves and others from COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""It's everyone's responsibility to screen themselves or their child for symptoms before going to school. If you're sick or someone in your household is sick, even with mild symptoms, please stay home.""
The new easy-to-use tool is voluntary and available for all parents, students and staff to use to help screen for symptoms of illness every day. Users will simply respond to clinician-informed symptom and risk questions, and the tool will then immediately inform users whether it is safe to attend school that day. The tool protects privacy and does not collect any personal health information. The tool was also developed in house by the Ontario Digital Service at no additional cost to taxpayers.
""Our government is taking every preventive action to safely reopen our schools, including the introduction of Ontario's new COVID-19 screening tool for students and staff,"" said Minister Lecce. ""We have made tremendous progress as a province, which is why we must continue to heighten our vigilance by stepping up screening of each student and staff member before they enter our schools."" 
Earlier this summer, Ontario unveiled the nation's most comprehensive plan for the safe reopening of schools in September. The plan is supported by $1.3 billion in critical supports to hire more teachers and increase physical distancing, purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), enhance cleaning of schools and school buses, improve ventilation, hire more custodians, and add more school leadership positions and administrative support for virtual schools. The province has also established a mandatory masking policy for grades 4-12, and a robust surveillance and testing strategy to ensure a successful return to classrooms.
In addition, local public health units have filled over 530 nursing positions, or 85 per cent, of the additional 625 nursing positions created to help keep students and staff safe. The nurses will be providing rapid-response support to schools and school boards in facilitating public health and preventative measures, including screening, testing, tracing and mitigation strategies. In order to ensure that schools are supported from the start of the school year, several public health units have temporarily redeployed existing nurses while recruitment activities continue.
As part of Ontario's commitment for transparency, and in partnership with the Ministry of Heath and the Ontario Digital Service, the Ministry of Education has also launched a webpage to report COVID-19 cases in schools and child care centres. This page will be updated every weekday with the most up-to-date COVID-19 information available, including a summary of cases in schools and licensed child care centres and agencies. This important resource will help parents and guardians know whether a COVID-19 case has been confirmed at their children's school, and where the numbers come from.
""As students across the province return to school, it's more important than ever that we provide families with the tools and information they need to stay safe and healthy,"" said Minister Bethlenfalvy. ""Throughout the pandemic, our government has worked swiftly to leverage technology and innovation that puts vital programs and services at your fingertips. This tool is another example of how we're building a government that works for you.""
The government also released the Operational Guidance: COVID-19 Management in Schools document. This guide was developed in consultation with public health experts, including Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and aims to help schools identify and isolate COVID-19 cases, reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools, and prevent and minimize outbreaks.
Quick Facts
Ontario has committed to making $1.3 billion in COVID-19 resources available to school boards in support of the COVID-19 outbreak, which includes $381 million in federal funding to support provincial back-to-school plans and $50 million in provincial funding for air quality and ventilation in schools.
For September, the government has delivered over 37 million pieces of PPE to Ontario’s 72 school boards and 10 education authorities, including more than 19.5 million masks, 16 million gloves, 317,000 face shields, 320,000 bottles of hand sanitizer, and 218,000 containers of disinfectant, among other critical supplies.
The Ontario government has named Dr. Dirk Huyer as Coordinator, Provincial Outbreak Response. In this role, he will lead the province’s efforts to prevent and minimize COVID-19 outbreaks in a number of sectors, including the education, child care, agriculture, and health care sectors.
The voluntary screening tool is one of several tools Ontarians should use to stop the spread of COVID-19. Other tools include Ontario’s self-assessment tool, which helps people check whether they have symptoms of COVID-19, and the COVID Alert app, which lets people know if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19—and alert others if they test positive.

Health Preparedness and Rebuilding the Economy Top Priorities in Ontario's Fall Legislative Agenda,"Priorities Will Advance the Government’s Plan for Growth, Renewal and Long-Term Recovery","September 14, 2020",Office of the Premier,"TORONTO — The Ontario government is returning to the legislature today, ready to continue implementing its made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and long-term recovery. The government's fall legislative agenda will build on the work undertaken over the summer, focusing on job creation, skills training, attracting investment, strengthening communities, and fortifying the front lines of the province's health care system. 
""Our government worked through the summer passing emergency legislation to protect individuals, families and businesses during one of the most difficult periods in our province's history,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""Over the past few weeks, we have heard from people in every corner of the province and from all walks of life that they continue to feel the impact of the pandemic each and every day. To start us down the road to long-term recovery, this legislative session will focus on implementing our comprehensive plan to get Ontario back on track.""
Priorities for the upcoming session include:
Investing in Ontario's health care system to ensure the province is prepared for a potential second wave of COVID-19 and for any future public health challenges;
Building Ontario's production capacity for personal protective equipment, ventilators and other medical gear so the province never has to rely on any other jurisdiction again for these critical supplies;
Protecting families and those most vulnerable and helping them get back on their feet as the province reopens;
Helping young people and workers receive the skills training they need to join the modern workforce and contribute to the recovery of the province;
Accelerating the construction of critical highway, transit and broadband infrastructure projects to create jobs and boost the local economies of communities across Ontario;
Providing relief to Mainstreet Ontario and small business owners so they can recover from the impact of COVID-19 faster and get back to the work of building their business; and
Expanding manufacturing by creating the conditions to bring investment and jobs to the province and world-class, Ontario-made products to consumers around the world.
""When faced with a global pandemic, Members of Provincial Parliament came together in an unprecedented level of cooperation to protect people and support businesses,"" said Paul Calandra, Ontario's Government House Leader. ""Working across party lines, we were able to quickly pass important programs and protective measures through a special summer sitting of the legislature. Now, as we return to regular fall sittings, the people of Ontario expect us to continue to cooperate to defeat COVID-19 and rebuild our economy.""
In March and through the summer, the legislature met for special sittings of the Assembly, which included unprecedented and innovative public health protections to allow for the passage of emergency legislation. From March to July, the government was successful in passing 18 pieces of legislation, including emergency measures needed to protect public health and prepare for economic recovery, such as the Economic and Fiscal Update Act, the COVID-19 Support and Protection Act, the Protecting Small Business Act, and the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act. The expedited passage of much of this emergency legislation would not have been possible without the support and cooperation of the Official Opposition and independent Members.
A full list of legislation passed during the summer session is available here.
Quick Facts
Since the Ontario legislature reconvened in February 2020, the government has passed 17 government bills and one private member’s bill. Of the 17 government bills passed, six of them received unanimous consent of all parties for expedited passage.
The legislature has sat for 22 days since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 220 hours of committee study to date hearing from nearly 500 witnesses.
The government took steps to implement unprecedented measures to allow the full participation of all Members of the Assembly, while respecting public health guidance, including: Permitting Members to vote from the public galleries and in the lobbies adjacent to the Chamber; Permitting Members to sit at, speak from, or vote from any desk in the Chamber; Managing the number of Members present in the Chamber at any given time; Permitting the use of virtual technology for meetings of Legislative Committees; Allocating additional Question Period questions to the Official Opposition and Independent Members; and completing an in-depth sectoral-based study at an expanded Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs to be conducted virtually to study the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and measures contributing to economic recovery.

Ontario Investing in Hospital Upgrades and Repairs,Maintaining Hospital Infrastructure to Ensure a Safe Environment for Patients,"September 14, 2020",Health,"MISSISSAUGA — The Ontario government is investing $175 million this year to address critical upgrades, repairs and maintenance in 129 hospitals across the province, including $50 million for COVID-19 related and other urgent projects. Through the Health Infrastructure Renewal Fund, this funding will help hospitals maintain their infrastructure and ensure a safe and comfortable environment for patients to receive care.
The announcement was made today by Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. As part of this funding, Trillium Health Partners will receive over $3.4 million to support projects across all three sites. Projects include replacing HVAC systems to improve indoor air quality, installing newer and more reliable nurse call systems for patients, and repairing roofs and elevators to maintain the facilities.
""Maintaining hospital infrastructure is another example of how our government is ensuring that Ontarians have access to health care services they can depend on, especially during these unprecedented times,"" said Elliott. ""Our ongoing investments to support essential projects like repairing roofs and windows and adding more isolation spaces can make a big difference to a patient's experience. It's part of our plan to build the capacity we need to end hallway health care in Ontario."" 
As the government continues to work toward bringing Ontario's world class health care system into the 21st century, this funding will help hospitals address urgent issues such as upgrades or replacement of roofs, windows, security systems, backup generators and fire alarms. Projects will also support hospitals in their ongoing response to COVID-19, such as updating HVAC systems to enhance patient and staff safety, creating additional isolation spaces and negative air pressure flow rooms to increase capacity, and enhancing infection prevention and control measures. 
""Delivering safe, exceptional care to our patients is our top priority and we know that our patients' physical environment plays an important role in their comfort, healing and recovery during their hospital stay,"" said Michelle DiEmanuele, President and CEO, Trillium Health Partners. ""This funding is an important part of creating a better environment for our patients to recover in and will allow us to make critical infrastructure repairs and upgrades across our three hospital sites.""  
""Ontario hospitals greatly appreciate this investment in critical infrastructure projects as it will improve quality of care for patients in communities across the province,"" said Anthony Dale, President and CEO, Ontario Hospital Association. ""Today's announcement is particularly important as it will help strengthen hospitals as they continue to serve in the months ahead as the anchor of the Province's response to the pandemic.""
Quick Facts
Ontario is investing an additional $7.4 million to address ongoing urgent and/or emergent infrastructure renewal needs for community health service providers who met specific criteria on a priority basis, through the Community Infrastructure Renewal Fund.

Ontario Launches New COVID-19 Screening Tool to Help Protect Students and Staff,New Tool Part of the Government’s Plan for the Safe Reopening of Schools,"September 16, 2020",Office of the Premier,"TORONTO — The Ontario government launched a new voluntary interactive screening tool to assist parents, students and staff with the daily assessment of COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors that is required before attending school. The results will let parents, students, and education staff know whether they should attend school each day or guide at-risk individuals to proper resources. This tool is another layer of prevention that the province is using to protect the health and safety of students, staff, and the communities where they live and work.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board.
""We are doing everything we can to keep students and staff safe, and that includes this new screening tool which will help people protect themselves and others from COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""It's everyone's responsibility to screen themselves or their child for symptoms before going to school. If you're sick or someone in your household is sick, even with mild symptoms, please stay home.""
The new easy-to-use tool is voluntary and available for all parents, students and staff to use to help screen for symptoms of illness every day. Users will simply respond to clinician-informed symptom and risk questions, and the tool will then immediately inform users whether it is safe to attend school that day. The tool protects privacy and does not collect any personal health information. The tool was also developed in house by the Ontario Digital Service at no additional cost to taxpayers.
""Our government is taking every preventive action to safely reopen our schools, including the introduction of Ontario's new COVID-19 screening tool for students and staff,"" said Minister Lecce. ""We have made tremendous progress as a province, which is why we must continue to heighten our vigilance by stepping up screening of each student and staff member before they enter our schools."" 
Earlier this summer, Ontario unveiled the nation's most comprehensive plan for the safe reopening of schools in September. The plan is supported by $1.3 billion in critical supports to hire more teachers and increase physical distancing, purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), enhance cleaning of schools and school buses, improve ventilation, hire more custodians, and add more school leadership positions and administrative support for virtual schools. The province has also established a mandatory masking policy for grades 4-12, and a robust surveillance and testing strategy to ensure a successful return to classrooms.
In addition, local public health units have filled over 530 nursing positions, or 85 per cent, of the additional 625 nursing positions created to help keep students and staff safe. The nurses will be providing rapid-response support to schools and school boards in facilitating public health and preventative measures, including screening, testing, tracing and mitigation strategies. In order to ensure that schools are supported from the start of the school year, several public health units have temporarily redeployed existing nurses while recruitment activities continue.
As part of Ontario's commitment for transparency, and in partnership with the Ministry of Heath and the Ontario Digital Service, the Ministry of Education has also launched a webpage to report COVID-19 cases in schools and child care centres. This page will be updated every weekday with the most up-to-date COVID-19 information available, including a summary of cases in schools and licensed child care centres and agencies. This important resource will help parents and guardians know whether a COVID-19 case has been confirmed at their children's school, and where the numbers come from.
""As students across the province return to school, it's more important than ever that we provide families with the tools and information they need to stay safe and healthy,"" said Minister Bethlenfalvy. ""Throughout the pandemic, our government has worked swiftly to leverage technology and innovation that puts vital programs and services at your fingertips. This tool is another example of how we're building a government that works for you.""
The government also released the Operational Guidance: COVID-19 Management in Schools document. This guide was developed in consultation with public health experts, including Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and aims to help schools identify and isolate COVID-19 cases, reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools, and prevent and minimize outbreaks.
Quick Facts
Ontario has committed to making $1.3 billion in COVID-19 resources available to school boards in support of the COVID-19 outbreak, which includes $381 million in federal funding to support provincial back-to-school plans and $50 million in provincial funding for air quality and ventilation in schools.
For September, the government has delivered over 37 million pieces of PPE to Ontario’s 72 school boards and 10 education authorities, including more than 19.5 million masks, 16 million gloves, 317,000 face shields, 320,000 bottles of hand sanitizer, and 218,000 containers of disinfectant, among other critical supplies.
The Ontario government has named Dr. Dirk Huyer as Coordinator, Provincial Outbreak Response. In this role, he will lead the province’s efforts to prevent and minimize COVID-19 outbreaks in a number of sectors, including the education, child care, agriculture, and health care sectors.
The voluntary screening tool is one of several tools Ontarians should use to stop the spread of COVID-19. Other tools include Ontario’s self-assessment tool, which helps people check whether they have symptoms of COVID-19, and the COVID Alert app, which lets people know if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19—and alert others if they test positive.

<p>As part of Ontario's commitment for transparency, and in partnership with the Ministry of Heath and the Ontario Digital Service, the Ministry of Education has also launched a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-cases-schools-and-child-care-centres"" data-mce-href=""https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-cases-schools-and-child-care-centres"">webpage to report COVID-19 cases in schools and child care centres</a>. This page will be updated every weekday with the most up-to-date COVID-19 information available, including a summary of cases in schools and licensed child care centres and agencies. This important resource will help parents and guardians know whether a COVID-19 case has been confirmed at their children's school, and where the numbers come from.</p>
<p>""As students across the province return to school, it's more important than ever that we provide families with the tools and information they need to stay safe and healthy,"" said Minister Bethlenfalvy. ""Throughout the pandemic, our government has worked swiftly to leverage technology and innovation that puts vital programs and services at your fingertips. This tool is another example of how we're building a government that works for you.""</p>
<p>The government also released the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ontario.ca/page/operational-guidance-covid-19-management-schools"" data-mce-href=""https://www.ontario.ca/page/operational-guidance-covid-19-management-schools""><em>Operational Guidance: COVID-19 Management in</em>&nbsp;<em>Schools</em></a>&nbsp;document. This guide was developed in consultation with public health experts, including Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and aims to help schools identify and isolate COVID-19 cases, reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools, and prevent and minimize outbreaks.</p>
